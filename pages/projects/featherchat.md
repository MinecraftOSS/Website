Want to take your serverâ€™s chat to the next level? Have pretty, customizable formatting for all your serverâ€™s messages? Be able to reuse pieces of text in multiple messages? Then FeatherChat might be what you are looking for!

Just want to have prefixes show up? Then FeatherChatâ€™s default configuration will make that happen, no setup needed.

* Attach permissions to chatting
* Simple chat channels functionality, including ranged and permission-based chat broadcasts
* Send any number of independent MOTD messages to players when they join the server
* Filter out specific phrases with permission-based overrides
