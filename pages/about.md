MinecraftOSS was founded in 2017 as the support server for various projects including EssentialsX, FactionsUUID and PlayerVaultsX.
Since then, we've evolved into an open community of **over 5000 members** and have been joined by several other notable open source projects,
including LWC Extended, NuVotifier and PermissionsEx!
